# FileSyncer

The name of this project is somewhat of a placeholder.

It's an attempt to create a Google Drive synchronization tool with a focus on implementing the OAuth2 flow from scratch.

Details on how to build on Windows are in BUILDING.md. For debug builds, a dynamic executable is created. For release builds, a static build is created.

Lots of implementation details are subject to change.
